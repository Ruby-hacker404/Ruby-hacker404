Download RubyGems v3.2.27 - September 03, 2021
RubyGems is a package management framework for Ruby. Download the latest version here:

TGZ ZIP GEM GIT
Or, to upgrade to the latest RubyGems:

$ gem update --system          # may need to be administrator or root
If you don't have any RubyGems installed, there is still the pre-gem approach to getting software, doing it manually:

Download from above
Unpack into a directory and cd there
Install with: ruby setup.rb (you may need admin/root privilege)
For more details and other options, see:

ruby setup.rb --help
